    <p class="clear" style="display: block; margin: 45px; color: #000000; font-size: 22px; text-align: justify;"><b>THE CHALLENGES WE FACE: </b>Each and everyone of us are faced with challenges in our lives.  How we respond too these challenges will determine our victory and or success in what has been allotted to us in this life.  I sincerely believe that each of us are born with purpose to fulfill our destiny in life.  We are given ablilities, strength, and wisdom to overcome any obstacle in our life, in other words we have the stuff.<img src="./img/founders3.png" alt="founders3" style="width:850px;height:500px; margin: 30px; box-shadow: 10px 12px 14px 4px #000000;"> We must also learn to not put our trust in others and there evaluation of us, that can cause use to be dependent on others and their cirticul judgemental attitude towards us.  We often tell ourselves that I must be approved by others to feel good about myself, and that simply is not true.  Ask yourself this question, how much of your life have you wasted trying to gain the approval of others? Basing our self-worth on what we believe others think of us causes us to become addicted to their approval.  That is way living according to the false belief I must be approved by certain others to feel good about myself causes  us to fear rejection, conforming virtually all of our attitudes and actions to the expectations of others.
    
    <br><br><b>DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF:</b> A common result of avoiding risks is FEAR.  Fear of failure is a willingness to be involved in only those activities that can be done well.  New and challenging activities are avoided because the risk of failure is too great.  Avoiding risks may seem comfortable, but it severely limits the scope of our creativity, self-expression, and service to others.  We have so much potential we've never recognized because we want to avoid the risk of failure.  A friend of mine from childhood took a job well below his capabilities, and I always wondered why until I understood this risk-avoidance concept.  In many areas of our lives and in many ways we avoid even trying to achieve success because we do not want to experience the pain of failure should we not succeed.
  
    <br><br><b>PERFECTION:</b> Another common symptom of fear of failure is perfection, an unwillingness to fail.  This tendency suffocates joy and creativity.  Because any failure is perceived as a threat to our self-esteem, we develop a propensity to focus our attention on the one area in which we failed rather than on those in which we did well.  Areas where we often tend tod be perfectionists include work, our appearance, and practically anything and everything.  Perfectionists often appear to be highly motivated, but their motivations usually come from a desperate attempt to avoid the low self-esteem they experience when they fail.  Perfectionists are often appreciated because they can be counted on to do a thorough job and are sometimes taken advantage of because of this characteristic.

    <br><br><b>PASSION - The Driving Force Within:</b> One of the greatest tragedies in life is to watch potential die untapped.  A greater tragedy is to watch potential live unreleased.  How sad to know that the majority of the people in this world will never discover who they really are and the potential they have.  Only a select few will make the quality decision to maximize every fiber of their lives by fully using their gifts, talents, abilities, and capabilities.  These are the potential's that lives within the each of us.  Don't be afraid of Passion because it is Passion that will take you to the next level in your life. Each one of us has the opportunity and capability to pursue and maximum our lives.  The question is, will we choose to exercise the option of being Passionate of our gifts, talents, and ablilities.
